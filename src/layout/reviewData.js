    review: "When I joined GIM after completing Std. 10, I felt that I wanted to be a developer, but when I heard about this GIM course and saw it, I felt that I should recognize my inner strength and then decide what I am made for. Chosen the Designing Field and today I work as a Team Leader in a very reputable company. And 30+ Employees work in my under right now. And since the job is 8 hours, I do freelance work comfortably. So behind this success, I would like to thank RNW age, the mentors there and send a message that every student should recognize their inner strength, advance their career and take up skill education",

Such as by conducting current market research by professionals, organizing field visits that give real-life experience to students, and many more. Thus after getting aware of all these facts, I opted to pursue my further study at the red and white institute.",
